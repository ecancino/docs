Prisma 5.0.0 introduces a number of changes, including the usage of our new JSON Protocol, [which make Prisma faster by default](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-and-serverless-73hbgKnZ6t#improved-startup-performance-by-9x). A full list of these changes can be found [in our release notes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/5.0.0).

This guide explains how upgrading might affect your application and gives instructions on how to handle breaking changes within Prisma 5.

## Upgrade the <inlinecode>prisma</inlinecode> and <inlinecode>@prisma/client</inlinecode> packages to Prisma 5

To upgrade to Prisma 5 from an earlier version, you need to update both the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages. Both the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages install with a caret `^` in their version number. This allows upgrades to new minor versions, but not major versions, to safeguard against breaking changes.

To ignore the caret `^` and upgrade across major versions, you can use the `@5` tag when you upgrade with `npm`, or `yarn`:

## Main changes

This section gives an overview of the main breaking changes in Prisma 5.

### Node.js minimum version change

From Prisma version 5.0.0, the minimum version of Node.js supported is 16.13.0. If your project uses an earlier version of Node.js, you will need to upgrade it.

See our [system requirements](/reference/system-requirements) for all minimum version requirements.

<Admonition type="info">

Node.js v16.x is reaching [end-of-life on 11 September 2023](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol) in order to coincide with the end-of-life of OpenSSL 1.1.1. For that reason, we recommend upgrading to the current Node.js LTS, v18.x. Please note that Prisma 5 will be the last major version of Prisma to support Node.js v16.

</Admonition>

### PostgreSQL minimum version change

From Prisma version 5.0.0, the minimum version of PostgreSQL supported is 9.6. If your project uses an earlier version of PostgreSQL, you will need to upgrade it.

### TypeScript minimum version change

From Prisma version 5.0.0, the minimum version of TypeScript supported is 4.7. If your project uses an earlier version of TypeScript, you will need to upgrade it.

### Removal of <inlinecode>rejectOnNotFound</inlinecode> parameter

From Prisma version 5.0.0, the deprecated parameter `rejectOnNotFound` has been removed. Depending on if your project used `rejectOnNotFound` globally or per query, there will be be different ways of updating your code.

#### Replacing <inlinecode>rejectOnNotFound</inlinecode> enabled at the client level.

For cases like these below:

```js
// Example 1
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  rejectOnNotFound: true,
})

// Example 2
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  rejectOnNotFound: {
    findUnique: true,
  },
})
```

You will need to update your codebase to use `findUniqueOrThrow` and `findFirstOrThrow` instead of `findUnique` and `findFirst`, depending on which calls you would like to throw.

If instead you use a custom error handler with the `rejectOnNotFound` property, like these examples:

```js
// Example 3
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  rejectOnNotFound: (err) => new Error('something'),
})

// Example 4
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  rejectOnNotFound: {
    findUnique: (err) => new Error('something'),
  },
})

// Example 5
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  rejectOnNotFound: {
    findFirst: {
      User: (err) => new Error('User error'),
      Post: (err) => new Error('Post error'),
    },
    findUnique: {
      User: (err) => new Error('User error'),
      Post: (err) => new Error('Post error'),
    },
  },
})
```

You will need to update your method usage to `...OrThrow` and then use a [client extension](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) in order to get the same behavior. As an example, the following extension would give the same behavior in Prisma 5 that `Example 5` gave in Prisma 4 and lower.

```js
const customErrorFunc = async (model, data) => {
  try {
    const result = await data
    return result
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Prisma.NotFoundError) {
      throw new Error(`${model} error`)
    }
    throw error
  }
}

prisma.$extends({
  query: {
    user: {
      findFirstOrThrow({ model, data }) {
        return await customErrorFunc(model, data)
      },
      findUniqueOrThrow({ model, data }) {
        return await customErrorFunc(model, data)
      },
    },
    post: {
      findFirstOrThrow({ model, data }) {
        return await customErrorFunc(model, data)
      },
      findUniqueOrThrow({ model, data }) {
        return await customErrorFunc(model, data)
      },
    },
  },
})
```

#### Replacing <inlinecode>rejectOnNotFound</inlinecode> enabled at the query level.

If you enable `rejectOnNotFound` on a per-query basis, you will need to replace your usage at the query level.

The following example:

```js
prisma.user.findFirst({
  where: { name: 'Alice' },
  rejectOnNotFound: true,
})
```

Is easily converted to:

```js
prisma.user.findFirstOrThrow({
  where: { name: 'Alice' },
})
```

If you use a custom error handler like the following:

```js
prisma.user.findFirst({
  where: { name: 'Alice' },
  rejectOnNotFound: () => new UserNotFoundError(),
})
```

You will need to modify your code to adapt your error handler to the errors returned by `...OrThrow` methods.

```js
const adaptError = (customThrowFn) => (error) => {
  if (error.code === 'P2025') {
    throw customThrowFn()
  }
  throw error
}

const user = await prisma.user.findFirstOrThrow({
  where: { name: 'Alice' },
}).catch(adaptError(() => new MyCustomError())
```

### Removal of array shortcuts

This version drops support for a number of "array shortcuts". These shortcuts were a way to add a single element as a value to an array-based operator instead of wrapping that one element in an array. To make our typings more consistent and logical, we now require array values for these operators.

In most cases, the fix will be as simple as wrapping the existing value in an array. Below are some specific examples of needed changes in Prisma 5.

#### <inlinecode>OR</inlinecode> operators

The following code in Prisma 4 and lower:

```js
prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: { email: 'foo@example.com' },
  },
})
```

Will need to be changed to the following in Prisma 5:

```js highlight=3;normal
prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [{ email: 'foo@example.com' }],
  },
})
```

`OR` operators will only accept array values.

#### <inlinecode>in</inlinecode> and <inlinecode>notIn</inlinecode> operators

Similar to `OR`, `in` and `notIn` require array values.

Prisma 4 and lower:

```js
prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: { in: 123 },
  },
})

prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: { notIn: 123 },
  },
})
```

Prisma 5:

```js highlight=4,12;normal
prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: {
      in: [123],
    },
  },
})

prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: {
      notIn: [123],
    },
  },
})
```

If your `in` and `notIn` values are only one element, you can also update your code to not use these operators at all:

```js highlight=3,9;normal
prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: 123,
  },
})

prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: { not: 123 },
  },
})
```

#### <inlinecode>path</inlinecode> argument for filtering on JSON fields in PostgreSQL

[When filtering on JSON fields in a PostgreSQL table](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/working-with-fields/working-with-json-fields#filter-on-a-json-field) the `path` argument now only accepts an array.

When using the following schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id       String @id
  settings Json
}
```

Prisma 4 and lower:

```js
prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    settings: {
      path: 'someSetting',
      equals: someValue,
    },
  },
})
```

Prisma 5:

```js highlight=4;normal
prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    settings: {
      path: ['someSetting'],
      equals: someValue,
    },
  },
})
```

<Admonition type="info">

Note: This `path` argument change only affects PostgreSQL databases. MySQL databases are not affected as they use a different syntax.

</Admonition>

#### Composite and Scalar lists

Operations on lists of [Composite](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-composite-types) and [Scalar](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#scalar-fields) types now only accept array values. The following examples all use the following schema:

```prisma
model Post {
  id           String    @id @default(uuid())
  commentsList Comment[]
  tags         String[]
}

type Comment {
  text String
}
```

##### <inlinecode>equals</inlinecode> filter for composite lists

[When using the `equals` filter with a composite list](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/composite-types#finding-records-that-contain-composite-types-with-find-and-findmany) you will only be able to supply array values.

Prisma 4 and lower:

```js
prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    commentsList: {
      equals: { text: 'hello' },
    },
  },
})
```

Prisma 5:

```js highlight=4;normal
prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    commentsList: {
      equals: [{ text: 'hello' }],
    },
  },
})
```

If you use the shorthand notation and exclude `equals`, you still must supply an array value for composite list fields.

Prisma 4 and lower:

```js
prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    commentsList: { text: 'hello' },
})

prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    commentsList: { text: 'hello' },
  },
})
```

Prisma 5:

```js highlight=3,8;normal
prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    commentsList: [{ text: 'hello' }],
})

prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    commentsList: [{ text: 'hello' }],
  },
})
```

##### Scalar lists

Scalar list values must be arrays in all operations.

Prisma 4 and lower:

```js
prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    tags: 'databases',
  },
})

prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    tags: 'databases',
  },
})
```

Prisma 5:

```js highlight=3,9;normal
prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    tags: ['databases'],
  },
})

prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    tags: ['databases'],
  },
})
```

### Prisma Client embedded SQLite version updated

With Prisma version 5.0.0, we have upgraded the embedded version of SQLite from `3.35.4` to `3.41.2`. We did not see any breaking changes and don't anticipate any changes needed in user projects, but if you are using SQLite, especially with raw queries that might go beyond Prisma's functionality, make sure to check [the SQLite changelog](https://www.sqlite.org/changes.html)

### <inlinecode>jsonProtocol</inlinecode> out of preview!

The `jsonProtocol` preview feature is now generally available. When upgrading to Prisma 5, make sure to remove `jsonProtocol` from your preview features, if added.

Prisma 4 and lower:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["jsonProtocol", "tracing"]
}
```

Prisma 5:

```prisma highlight=3;delete
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["tracing"]
}
```

#### Improved error messages

Due to the switch to the new protocol, several error messages have been improved. For example, the following error message in Prisma 4 and below

```text
Argument id for where.id must not be null. Please use undefined instead.
```

becomes the following in Prisma 5:

```text
Argument `id` must not be null.
```

### <inlinecode>cockroachdb</inlinecode> provider is now required when connecting to a CockroachDB database

### Removal of <inlinecode>runtime/index.js</inlinecode> from generated client

The `runtime/index.js` file has been removed from the Prisma Client.

#### Using public APIs from <inlinecode>runtime/index.js</inlinecode>

Importing from `@prisma/client/runtime` is no longer available in Prisma 5. If you were using public APIs available in this namespace before, you can instead import `Prisma` and access them. For example:

```js
import { Decimal } from '@prisma/client/runtime'
const num = new Decimal(24.454545)
```

will need to be changed to

```js
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'
const num = new Prisma.Decimal(24.454545)
```

#### Using private APIs for a specific runtime

We highly discourage the use of internal private APIs as they can change without warning and are not guaranteed to be supported. If your usage requires a private API that was previous available [please reach out to us on GitHub.](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)

## Other changes

The following changes may cause an application to initially throw an error message after upgrading to Prisma 5. Fortunately, they are easy to solve, as the underlying functionality has been removed for a while or the change is a simple string replace.

### Removal of deprecated Prisma CLI flags

Several deprecated CLI flags have been removed. All following flags are from previous APIs and are no longer needed:

- `--preview-feature` used in `db execute`, `db seed`, and `db diff`
- `--experimental` and `--early-access-feature` used in `migrate`
- `--force`/`-f` used in `db push`
- `--experimental-reintrospection` and `--clean` used in `db pull`

The outdated use of `db push --force` can be replaced with the newer implementation `db push --accept-data-loss`.

All other flags are from previous APIs and are no longer needed.

### Removal of the <inlinecode>beforeExit</inlinecode> hook from the library engine

The `beforeExit` hook has been removed from the Prisma library engine. Instead of this hook we recommend using built-in Node.js exit events.

The following code with Prisma 4:

```js
const exitHandler = () => {
  // your exit handler code
}

prisma.$on('beforeExit', exitHandler)
```

Could become:

```js
const exitHandler = () => {
  // your exit handler code
}

process.on('exit', exitHandler)
process.on('beforeExit', exitHandler)
process.on('SIGINT', exitHandler)
process.on('SIGTERM', exitHandler)
process.on('SIGUSR2', exitHandler)
```

### Removal of deprecated <inlinecode>prisma2</inlinecode> executable

When we released Prisma 2, the `prisma2` executable was used in order to differentiate from Prisma 1. In a later release, the `prisma` executable was added and the Prisma 1 executable was renamed to `prisma1`.

Needless to say, the `prisma2` executable has been deprecated for some time and is now removed. If your scripts use Prisma CLI as `prisma2`, please replace it with simply `prisma`.

### Removal of deprecated <inlinecode>experimentalFeatures</inlinecode> property

The `previewFeatures` field of the [generator block](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#fields-1) used to be called `experimentalFeatures`. We are finally removing that deprecated property.

In Prisma 5, you will need to update references of `experimentalFeatures` to `previewFeatures` manually or use the new code action in the Prisma VSCode extension.

### <inlinecode>migration-engine</inlinecode> renamed to <inlinecode>schema-engine</inlinecode>

The engine responsible for commands like `prisma migrate` and `prisma db` has been renamed from `migration-engine` to `schema-engine` to better describe its use. For many users, no changes will be required. However, if you need to explicitly include or exclude this engine file for any reason, you will need to update your code references.

One example we have seen is projects using the Serverless Framework. In these instances, you may have rules such as:

```yaml
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-rhel-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/migration-engine-*'
```

The rule `'!node_modules/prisma/migration-engine-*'` rule will need to be updated to match the new naming.

The [recommended rule from our documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/use-prisma-with-serverless-framework#lambda-functions-with-arm64-architectures) is not affected by this change as it excludes all non desired engine files.

```yaml highlight=6;normal
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-rhel-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

Enjoy Prisma 5!
